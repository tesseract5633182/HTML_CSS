Suppose you want to add 2 images side by side of 580 px then we should use min-width
Once we add an another lement then the size will get automatically adjusted to 580px


button.normal{

} 
we can use this in the css and then in out html we can add the class as normal for buttons, this will only work for button since we are 
using button.normal


We can add multiple class name as well
<div class="banner-box banner-box-2"> --> here banner-box and banner-box-2 are 2 different class name
and in the style sheet we can simply use this other class name to target the element 

#sm-banner .banner-box-2{

}


There is an attribute called white-space = nowrap which made the the Sign Up text to show up in a single line.


We had to use #pageheader.blog-header to change the background image, using #pageheader .blog-header was not able to change the background 
image


Suppose we have 3 elements in display flex and we want to move the third element to some other place
then we should mark the 3rd element as position=absolute and use relative on in parent
To push an element behing other elemet we should use z-index = -1, it should be negative any negative value is fine.
And z-index should be positive to keep it on the top of other element

#cart table td:nth-child(1){
    width: 100px;
}
we can use the nth-child pseudo code to target just the nth child of the parent element
